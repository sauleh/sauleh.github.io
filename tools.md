# My favorite tools
I like to list my favoirte tools, so I can keep track of them and I can also point friends/students/colleagues to this list. This is a first draft. I will add more items as I remember/discover/have time.
* [Windows SysInternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/): Collection of the best and most advanced system tools for the windows operating system. It has many tools that deserve their own separate entry. 
* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/): Why is my hard disk full? The best free tool I found to answer this question.
* [Meld](https://meldmerge.org): I love Beyond Compare but it is not free. Meld is the best free tool I found. I've also used WinMerge, but Meld seems to have a more intuitive UI.
* [FlashBack Express](https://www.flashbackrecorder.com/express/): I've used the free version of Flashback Express for several semesters to record my lectures. It's the best free tool I've found and I have no complaints!
